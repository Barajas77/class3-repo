I am a recent college grad with a buisiness degree and a major in Finance. I currently work as loss prevention for Old Navy.
MY carrer goals are to enter the Fintech job market and work in something related to blockchain or cryptocurrenty.
I think Fintech is the way of the future and will be a bigger part of our day to day.
